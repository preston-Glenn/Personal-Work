Hi Dr. Gupta,

I am the new Director of Communication for the student organization The Association for Computing Machinery, and I was informed that our organization last year could email cs-room-reservations@utdallas.edu CCing you on it to reserve a room in ECSS. For this coming year will this still be the case?

Also, is there any way that we could reserve rooms in ECS West? Our ACM projects team would perhaps like to host their weekly build nights in ECSW 3.210 during the school year. 

The reason I ask you is that there is currently not a way in EMS to reserve a room in ECSW. Because of this, I emailed cs-room-reservations simply inquiring about the possibility and they stated that all student groups must go through EMS or I should contact the Mechanical engineering department, who said the same thing. However, I also contacted our faculty advisor, Prof. Cole, who then emailed the cs-room-reservations and got a similar response stating that "ECSW is not allowing student group reservations in ECSW".

Our ACM Projects team are still planning, so I am not requesting to reserve a room at the moment, I am just inquiring to see if you would be able to help us reserve this room in the future.



Thank you for your time,

Preston Glenn
